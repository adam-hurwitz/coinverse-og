# Features

#### Vaults

- Encrypted
    - End-to-end encrypted (E2EE)
    - Private encrypted and share options
    - Encrypted files are available for anyone to download
    - Current AES-256 encryption requires $2.29x10^{32}$ years

- Public
    - Not end-to-end encrypted (E2EE)
- Terms of access (ToA)
    - You can add terms of access to be digitally signed before someone is added to a vault.
- Creating vaults and uploading files takes time depending on the data transactions settling on the Arweave network.
    - Based on the Arweave network demand and bandwidth.
    - *See [How long do transactions take to confirm?](https://docs.akord.com/v/app-docs/frequently-asked-questions/how-long-do-transactions-take-to-confirm)*
- Revoke files
    - Cannot delete files because data stored on Arweave is permanent
    - Revoking prevents anyone from renaming, moving, downloading, or viewing the file.
        - The file continues to exist.
        - The file remains encrypted and is therefore useless. 
    - Opportunity
