## Features

#### Voting types

- *See [Voting systems](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types) by Snapshot*
- Single choice
- Approval
- Ranked choice
- Weighted
- Quadratic
    - Individual voters matter more than the individual's voting power.
    - Votes can be weighted across multiple choices.
    - The amount of votes counted for an individual are the square root of their voting credits.
        - E.g.
            - 4 voting credits = 2 votes
            - 16 voting credits = 4 votes
    - Relies on strong sybil resistance to ensure each individual is an actual person.
    - *See [Quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting) by Wikipedia*

## Opportunities

#### Time power voting

- Reduce the entity token voting power as time elapses.
- This potentially reduces large entities from voting at the very end of an election to attempt to influence the outcome.
- Sub-strategy that can be applied on top of an existing voting strategy
- E.g. Day 0 the entity has 100% voting power, day 14 they have 80% of the voting power
- *See [@adamshurwitz Tweet 2023-07-05](https://twitter.com/adamshurwitz/status/1676687593155571712)*

#### Change fees

- Reduce the entity token voting power when a vote is changed.
- This potentially reduces large entities from voting deceptively by changing their vote multiple times.
- Sub-strategy that can be applied on top of an existing voting strategy
- E.g. Reduce voting power by 15% each time the vote is changed.
